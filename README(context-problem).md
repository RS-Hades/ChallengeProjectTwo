This is my second project I've developed and the first time I used grid to make a website responsive.

The problem is the following: 
When you display the website in the browser and you wanna go to one of the three sections through the points in the header, the header overlaps the first top part of each section,
like each section starts in the top of the browser, but I intend that the sections start just under the bottom of the header when you click on the anchor element of that section
in the header.

I would like if someone can help me with this because I know, I'll do many more projects in the future with the same feature, that's why it's important to me know what's the problem.
